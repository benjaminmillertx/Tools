The following Java code demonstrates a basic schizophrenia test using the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) questionnaire, which is often used in clinical settings. The code prints the results to the console, but you can modify it to display the results in a user-friendly format.
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SchizophreniaTest {

    private static final String[] QUESTIONS = {
            "Do you often have strange or irrational ideas?",
            "Do you experience hallucinations or see things that others do not see?",
            "Do you feel like people are trying to harm or control you?",
            "Do you have difficulty expressing your emotions?",
            "Do you find it hard to start conversations or maintain relationships?",
            "Do you often feel that your thoughts are slowed down or jumbled?",
            "Do you have trouble concentrating or making decisions?",
            "Do you feel passive or lack motivation?",
            "Do you feel emotionally flat or detached from others?"
    };

    private static final int NUM_QUESTIONS = QUESTIONS.length;
    private static final int MAX_SCORE = 7;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int totalScore = 0;
        SchizophreniaTest test = new SchizophreniaTest();

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Schizophrenia Test!");
        System.out.println("This test is for educational purposes only and should not replace a professional medical diagnosis.");

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        for (String question : QUESTIONS) {
            System.out.println(question);
            System.out.println("Enter a score between 1 (not at all) and 7 (extremely):");
            int score = scanner.nextInt();
            totalScore += test.validateScore(score, 1, MAX_SCORE) ? score : 0;
        }

        float averageScore = (float) totalScore / NUM_QUESTIONS;
        System.out.printf("Your total score is: %d%n", totalScore);
        System.out.printf("Your average score is: %.2f%n", averageScore);

        if (averageScore < 2.5) {
            System.out.println("Your score suggests that you are unlikely to have schizophrenia.");
        } else if (averageScore < 3.5) {
            System.out.println("Your score suggests that you might have mild symptoms associated with schizophrenia. You should consult a mental health professional if you have concerns.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Your score suggests that you might have significant symptoms associated with schizophrenia. You should consult a mental health professional immediately.");
        }
    }

    private boolean validateScore(int score, int min, int max) {
        return score >= min && score <= max;
    }
}
This code provides a simple console-based schizophrenia test using the PANSS questionnaire. As stated before, the test should not be used as a substitute for a professional medical diagnosis, but rather as an educational tool for raising awareness about schizophrenia.
