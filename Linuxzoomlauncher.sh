zoom_meeting_launcher.sh script that includes the custom name, description, and timer for the Zoom meeting:
#!/bin/bash

# Customize the following variables
meeting_name="My Meeting"
room_description="This is the description of my room"
start_date="2023-02-20 14:00:00" # YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

# Convert the start date to seconds since the epoch
start_time=$(date -d "$start_date" +%s)

# Get the current time in seconds since the epoch
current_time=$(date +%s)

# Calculate the remaining time until the meeting starts
remaining_time=$((start_time - current_time))

# Wait for the remaining time before launching the meeting
if [ $remaining_time -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "Waiting for $remaining_time seconds before launching the meeting..."
  sleep $remaining_time
fi

# Construct the Zoom meeting URL with the custom name and description
meeting_url="zoom.us/j/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)?pwd=$meeting_name-$room_description"

# Launch the Zoom meeting with the constructed URL
zoom "$meeting_url"
Save the file and exit the text editor. Then, make the script executable by running chmod +x zoom_meeting_launcher.sh in the terminal. You can run the script with ./zoom_meeting_launcher.sh to schedule the meeting to launch at the specified date and time.
Note: The script uses the sleep command to wait for the remaining time before launching the meeting. If you need to run other commands before the meeting starts, you can add them to the script before the sleep command. Also, the script uses the date command to convert the start date to seconds since the epoch, and to construct the Zoom meeting URL with the custom name and description. You can customize the format of the URL by modifying the meeting_url variable in the script.
