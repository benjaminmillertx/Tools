Here's a simplified example of how you can create a basic Korean translation app in Python using the Naver Papago Translate API:
from translate import Translator

def translate_to_korean(text):
    translator = Translator(to_lang="ko", papago_apikey="YOUR_API_KEY")
    translation = translator.translate(text)
    return translation

def main():
    text_to_translate = input("Enter a text to translate to Korean: ")
    translated_text = translate_to_korean(text_to_translate)
    print(f"Translated Text: {translated_text}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Note: Make sure to replace your actual Naver Papago Translate API key in place of YOUR_API_KEY in the example provided. This is a basic example and may need further customization based on your app requirements, user interface design, error handling, and additional functionalities.
Please refer to the Naver Papago Translate API documentation and terms of service for more details on implementing translation services securely and effectively in your Python application.
