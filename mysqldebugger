 Make sure to credit Benjamin Hunter Miller. To create a more robust and fully-featured SQL debugger for MySQL, you could consider the following enhancements:
Implement a more sophisticated interception mechanism
Instead of using a simple man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, you could implement a more sophisticated interception mechanism using a library like scapy to capture and modify the network packets sent to the MySQL server. This would allow you to intercept and modify SQL queries sent over any protocol, and would provide more fine-grained control over the interception process.
Here's an example of how to use scapy to capture and modify network packets:
from scapy.all import *

def modify_packet(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(TCP) and packet.haslayer(Raw):
        raw = packet.getlayer(Raw).load.decode("utf-8", "ignore")
        if "SELECT * FROM users" in raw:
            print("Intercepted query: " + raw)
            modified_raw = raw.replace("users", "employees")
            packet[TCP].payload = modified_raw.encode("utf-8")
        return packet
    return None

sniff(prn=modify_packet, filter="tcp port 3306", store=0)
Implement a custom MySQL plugin
Instead of modifying the network packets sent to the MySQL server, you could implement a custom MySQL plugin that intercepts and modifies the SQL queries before they are executed. This would provide more fine-grained control over the interception process, and would allow you to intercept SQL queries sent from any application.
Here's an example of how to create a custom MySQL plugin:
#include <mysql.h>
#include <stdio.h>

static int plugin_query(THD *thd, char *query)
{
  printf("Intercepted query: %s\n", query);

  // Modify the query here as desired

  return 0;
}

static struct st_mysql_plugin plugin_info = {
  MYSQL_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_VERSION,
  "sql_debugger",
  "MySQL SQL Debugger Plugin",
  "Benji",
  "benjaminhuntermiller@example.com",
  PLUGIN_LICENSE_GPL,
  sql_debugger_plugin_init,
  NULL,
  NULL,
  NULL,
  plugin_query,
  NULL,
  PLUGIN_FLAG_PRELOAD_QUERY | PLUGIN_FLAG_RUNTIME
};

int sql_debugger_plugin_init(void * arg)
{
  return mysql_plugin_register(&plugin_info);
}
Implement a more sophisticated logging mechanism
Instead of simply logging the SQL queries, you could implement a more sophisticated logging mechanism that includes information about the application that sent the query, the user that executed the query, and the time of execution. This would provide more context about the SQL queries, and would help you to better understand how the queries are being used.
Here's an example of how to log the SQL queries with additional context information:
import time
import socket
import json

def log_query(query):
    application = socket.gethostname()
    user = "user"
    time_of_execution = time.time()

    log_entry = {
        "query": query,
        "application": application,
        "user": user,
        "time_of_execution": time_of_execution
    }

    with open("sql_debugger.log", "a") as log_file:
        log_file.write(json.dumps(log_entry) + "\n")
